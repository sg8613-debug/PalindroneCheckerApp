USE CASE 2 : Hardcoded Palindrome Check 

-use hardcoded string "madam"
- reversed string using loop
- compared origin and reversed string 
- printd result using if-else

Use case 3 :

* this class checks whether the string is palindrome
* by reversing string and compairing with it with
* th original value

Use case 4: reversed string based palindrome check

* this class validates a palindrome by converting
* the string into the character array and compairing
* characters using the two pointer technique
